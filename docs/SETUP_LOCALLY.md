# Setting Up a Local Development Environment

There are a few options for setting up a local development environment.

## Run EBWiki in Virtualbox with Vagrant
VirtualBox is a virtualization tool that allows you to run virtual machines on your local workstation.  Vagrant is a tool for managing virtual machine environments that run in VirtualBox.  

Using these tools together, you can build the EBWiki envionment without having to install services on your local workstation.

Follow the instructions in [Developing EBWiki with Vagrant](docs/VAGRANT.md) to get started.

## Run Services Locally
All of the services EBWiki needs to run can be installed on your local workstation.  Setting up services locally is an involved process but gives you the most control over your development environment.

Follow the instructions in [Developing EBWiki with Local Services](doc/LOCAL_SERVICES.md) to get started.
